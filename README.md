# UCI-SECOM

### Introduction 

In this project I have taken semiconductor manufacturing dataset from UCI. The modern semiconductor manufacturing process is extremly complex and evolving every day.

The following alorithims were applied in order to reduce the dimension of 590 features.

(1) Low Variance (Varience Threshold)

(2) Logistic Regression

(3) Random Forest

(4) Support Vector Classification

(5) Linear SVC (similar to SVC but with kernel = 'linear')

(6) PCA(Principal Component Analysis)
